# My First Minecraft Mod

## Enviornment

- jdk-17.0.3+7
    - [Download](https://adoptium.net/)
- MDK Version 1.18.1
    - [Download](https://files.minecraftforge.net/net/minecraftforge/forge/index_1.18.1.html)


## Running instructions

1. Depending on the IDE you are using - you will need to run the IDE Launch/Run Configurations
    - For Eclipse, run the genEclipseRuns gradle task (gradlew genEclipseRuns). This will generate the Launch Configurations and download any required assets for the game to run. After this has finished, refresh your project. 
    - For IntelliJ, run the genIntellijRuns gradle task (gradlew genIntellijRuns). This will generate the Run Configurations and download any required assets for the game to run. If you encounter an error saying “module not specified”, you can either edit the configuration to select your “main” module or specify it through the ideaModule property.
    - For VSCode, run the genVSCodeRuns gradle task (gradlew genVSCodeRuns). This will generate the Launch Configurations and download any required assets for the game to run.
2. To build and test the mod, please follow [Forge Docs for building and testing](https://mcforge.readthedocs.io/en/1.18.x/gettingstarted/#building-and-testing-your-mod)
